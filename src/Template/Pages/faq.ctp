<h2><b>What are the themes of the Conference?</b></h2>
<p>The conference aims to <b><em>deepen our understanding of how lean thinking can deliver improvement for patients, staff and the organization</em></b>.
    The conference organizers are committed to building a program based on delegate contribution and will be attempting to provide answers to the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where are our improvements focused and where are we achieving the most success?</li>
    <li>What are the examples of value stream redesign or active daily management system implementation where outcomes or lessons learned will deepen our knowledge of the approach?</li>
    <li>How are we developing our people to integrate problem solving and improvement into their work? What impact is this capability development having for our patients, staff and organization?</li>
    <li>Is Lean thinking helping us reduce costs? What progress have we made?</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How do I register and what will it cost?</b></h2>
